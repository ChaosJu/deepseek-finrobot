## Phase: Refining Dynamic Exits with Sentiment Intelligence
**Date:** 2024-06-16

**Objective:**
To enhance the dynamic trade management capabilities of the `ChiefExecutiveOfficerAgent` by making exit decisions (both stop-loss and profit-taking) more directly responsive to market psychology indicators (fear, greed, crisis sentiment) and strong counter-signals from the core strategy. This aims to improve profitability and risk management by aligning exits more closely with the bot's core philosophy of exploiting human weakness, moving beyond purely technical or volatility-based exits.

**Design Details Implemented:**

1.  **Greed-Based Profit-Taking Refinements:**
    *   **Triggers:** Activated for profitable BUY trades when specific "greed" categories are detected from `NewsSentimentAgent` (e.g., "OverhypedRally", "IrrationalExuberance") or `MarketThemeSentimentAgent` (e.g., "Highly Euphoric" theme), and the trade has achieved a minimum profit factor.
    *   **Configurable Strategies:**
        *   `FullExit`: Close entire position.
        *   `PartialAndTightenTrail`: Close a configured percentage, then significantly tighten the ATR trailing stop on the remainder.
        *   `TightenTrailOnly`: Only significantly tighten the ATR trailing stop.
    *   **Configuration:** Parameters added to `profit_taking_config` for enablement, trigger categories, minimum profit factor, chosen strategy, partial exit percentage, and tightened N_ATR for trail.

2.  **Fear-Based Short Covering:**
    *   **Triggers:** Activated for profitable SHORT trades when "fear capitulation" signals are detected from `NewsSentimentAgent` (e.g., "IrrationalPanic") or `MarketThemeSentimentAgent` (e.g., "Capitulation/Panic" theme), and a minimum profit factor is met.
    *   **Action:** Full exit (BUY_TO_COVER) of the short position.
    *   **Configuration:** Parameters added to `profit_taking_config` for enablement, trigger categories, and minimum profit factor.

3.  **Crisis Exit for Long Positions:**
    *   **Triggers:** Activated for active LONG positions if `NewsSentimentAgent` detects a post-entry change to a high-risk "crisis" category (e.g., "FundamentalScandalOrCrisis").
    *   **Configurable Strategies:**
        *   `ImmediateExitOnCrisis`: Full exit of the position.
        *   `TightenStopOnCrisis`: Aggressively tighten the ATR stop-loss to a minimal N_ATR.
    *   **Configuration:** Parameters added to `stop_loss_config` for enablement, trigger categories, chosen strategy, and tightened N_ATR for crisis stop.

4.  **Counter-Signal Exit:**
    *   **Triggers:** Activated for an existing position if the `ContrarianSignalGenerator` issues a new, high-confidence, directly opposing signal for the same asset, with a qualifying `detailed_sentiment_category`.
    *   **Action:** Full exit of the current position.
    *   **Configuration:** Parameters added to `stop_loss_config` for enablement, confidence threshold for the counter-signal, and lists of qualifying opposing sentiment categories.

**Implementation Notes:**
*   All logic primarily implemented within the `ChiefExecutiveOfficerAgent`'s `_check_and_manage_active_trades` method.
*   Configuration parameters loaded via `_load_profit_taking_config` and `_load_stop_loss_config`.
*   Careful ordering of exit condition checks implemented within the active trade management loop.

**New Configurations (in `configs/contrarian_strategy_config.yaml`):**
*   Under `profit_taking_config`: `use_greed_based_profit_taking`, `news_sentiment_greed_categories_for_buy_exit`, `market_theme_greed_assessments_for_buy_exit`, `min_profit_factor_for_greed_exit_buy`, `greedy_exit_strategy_buy`, `greedy_partial_exit_percentage_buy`, `greedy_tightened_n_atr_trail_buy`, `use_fear_based_short_covering`, `news_sentiment_fear_categories_for_short_cover`, `market_theme_fear_assessments_for_short_cover`, `min_profit_factor_for_fear_cover_short`.
*   Under `stop_loss_config`: `use_crisis_exit_for_long`, `crisis_exit_strategy_for_long`, `news_sentiment_crisis_categories_for_long_exit`, `crisis_tightened_n_atr_stop_long`, `use_counter_signal_exit`, `threshold_exit_on_counter_signal_confidence`, `counter_signal_sell_categories_for_long_exit`, `counter_signal_buy_categories_for_short_exit`.

**Testing Strategy Considerations:**
*   Unit tests for CEO agent to cover each new exit logic path with mocked inputs.
*   Backtesting scenarios designed to specifically trigger these sentiment-driven exits to evaluate their impact on P&L, drawdowns, and trade duration.
*   Analysis of logs to confirm exits are triggered by the intended conditions.

**Rationale:**
*   This refinement directly addresses user feedback to make stop-loss and profit-taking mechanisms less generic and more aligned with the core strategy of exploiting market psychology (greed and fear). It aims to improve trade outcomes by capturing profits more effectively during euphoria, exiting shorts during panic, and protecting capital when a trade's premise is invalidated by crisis news or strong counter-signals.
